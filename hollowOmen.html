        <div class="projectDescription">

            <p>Hollow Omen is a 2D action-platformer developed as a prototype in my final college semester. It
                served as a learning project for refining my Unity coding abilities, applying coding designs and
                principles, working with Unityâ€™s physics engine, and prototyping enemy behaviors using basic AI
                programming.</p>

                    <h2>Player Movement</h2>
                    <p>
                        The player movement system delivers smooth, seamless transitions between running, jumping, and
                        falling by using a state pattern design. This approach isolates each movement state, making
                        debugging and monitoring more efficient to ensure precise behavior.

                        Additionally, I synchronized character animations with gameplay actions using the Animator
                        component, creating clear visual feedback for every movement and transition. This resulted in a
                        highly responsive and intuitive control experience.

                    <h2>Player Combat</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the combat, I have implemented attack options, including a fluid
                        slash combo, each paired with distinct visual and sound effects for greater impact. Carefully
                        designed hitboxes improve strike precision, making combat feel strategic and rewarding.

                        A key feature is the parry mechanic, allowing players to deflect enemy attacks and projectiles
                        with skillful timing.

                    <h2>Enemy Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the player, I developed an enemy controller using a state machine and state pattern
                        to enable smooth transitions between states like idle, attack, and pursuit. This modular design
                        keeps behaviors organized and easy to debug.

                        To support future growth, the enemy framework is built with inheritance for easy customization
                        and extension. Although only one enemy variant currently exists, this scalable structure ensures
                        seamless integration of new types, laying a solid foundation for a diverse enemy roster.

                    <h2>Interaction System</h2>
                    <p>

                        In designing the Interaction System, the primary objective was to empower players with a
                        versatile tool for engaging with diverse elements within the game, including item pickups, NPC
                        interactions, and textual readings. To achieve this, I developed a dynamic system, leveraging
                        the efficiency of delegates and events. This not only ensures seamless interaction handling but
                        also establishes a foundation for scalability, allowing the feature to evolve alongside the
                        gameplay dynamics.

                    <h2>Raytracing</h2>
                    <p>

                        In this project, I leveraged ray tracing to enhance both combat mechanics and audio immersion.
                        Utilizing ray
                        tracing, I ensured precise hitboxes for player attacks, elevating the combat experience with
                        accurate collision
                        detection. Additionally, I designed footsteps sound system which, dynamically generates distinct
                        sounds
                        based on the ground type. This innovative approach employs ray tracing to detect the surface
                        beneath, providing
                        players with an immersive auditory experience tied intricately to the in-game environment.
