            <p> Student Survivor is a 2D action roguelike crafted in Unity, inspired by iconic titles like Vampire
                Survivors and Hades. As my first step into game development, this project emerged from a fast-paced
                development process that challenged me to think creatively and adapt quickly to new tools and concepts.
                Designed as an educational project, Student Survivor reflects my initial exploration of Unity’s
                capabilities, balancing technical learning with imaginative design to create an engaging player
                experience. Here, I’m excited to share some of the unique features that define the game and to showcase
                the technical layers that bring Student Survivor to life.</p>

                    <p>
                        Take control as the player, utilizing automated attacks to obliterate waves of randomized
                        enemies, leveling up your
                        character, and unlocking new abilities along the way. Navigate through the levels, collecting
                        consumables
                        to enhance your survival odds. The pinnacle of each level introduces a boss spawning on
                        a timer, compelling the player to amass as much power as possible before the boss arrives.

                        Explore the diverse gameplay options with three distinct classes in the game, each offering a
                        unique playstyle and
                        providing players with varied ways to experience the game. Every class is equipped with
                        exclusive abilities and
                        individualized stats, ensuring a different gaming experience. Additionally, each class boasts
                        its own set of animations,
                        adding a touch of character and uniqueness to the gameplay visuals.

                    <p>
                        The game comes with 2 bosses and 11 different enemies spread across 2
                        levels in the game. The implementation utilizes the concept of inheritance to organize and
                        structure the code, ensuring a high degree of customizability for the enemies. Each enemy and
                        boss is implemented
                        with distinct animations and individualized stats, adding variety to the gameplay. Moreover, the
                        bosses come with different mechanics and phases, keeping the boss fights unique and challenging.

                    <p>
                        To ensure dynamic progression, I developed a randomized upgrade system for the player character.
                        Upon leveling up,
                        players are presented with a choice of three random upgrades, spanning from unlocking new
                        abilities, enhancing existing
                        skills, to boosting player stats. This system adds an element of unpredictability and strategic
                        decision-making,
                        ensuring each playthrough offers a unique and personalized experience.

                        graphs for the first time.
                        I designed shaders for both player and enemies, improving visual clarity to distinctly represent
                        various
                        states such as poisoning, freezing, empowerment, or impact.
